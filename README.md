# GT101: Worksheet 2

In this worksheet you'll be experimenting with data structures. We've provided all the code to get you started,
including a game, in which you'll need to implement various algorithms and data-structures to re-enable it's removed
functionality. More details are available on Blackboard.

# Structure

Each program that can be executed has its own launch_*.py script. Right click on select to start to create a new
configuration. All the scripts you need to edit and add functionality too are in the tasks folder and are clearly
labeled. You do not have to edit any other files to complete the four tasks.

# Audio

This worksheet uses a sound engine based on FMOD. If you haven't already installed the library, we've included the
necessary files with the game's source code. However, there are some general instructions to follow to ensure the python
library installs correctly.

## Windows & Mac OS

1. Ensure you have Git installed
2. Create a virtual environment using PyCharm's default recommendations
3. Open a terminal in PyCharm and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to double-check everything is installed 

## Linux

1. Ensure you have Git installed
2. Create a virtual environment using PyCharm's default recommendations
3. Open a terminal in PyCharm and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  to double-check everything is installed 
4. Add LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. to the environment path. You can do this in the environment variables section in "Edit
